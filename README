This directory contains two scripts used for handling bounced emails. The first is
bounceback.pl which is run on EPLAPP and modifies customer's accounts.
The second is uniqbounce.pl which manages a list of emailed customers. This script is
not used regularly and was developed to help with the situation where Microsoft
blacklisted our site and hotmail customers no longer received our notices.

Until that got fixed, we emailed customers through our marketing accout at EPL,
that they we could not reach them by email so please check your account online
to find out what fees, fines, holds you have. See documentation in the perl script.
